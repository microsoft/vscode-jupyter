Warn users when a Python file could override an existing Python package (there by interfering with the kernels. [More info](https://aka.ms/JupyterKernelStartFailureOverrideReservedName)).
    This feature could be turned off via the setting `"jupyter.diagnostics.reservedPythonNames.enabled": false`.
