# Prerequisites

-   Python 3.7 and higher
-   run `python3 -m pip install --user -r news/requirements.txt`

# Release candidate (Friday of VS Code endgame week, XXX XX)

-   [ ] Update [Component Governance](https://dev.azure.com/vscode-python-datascience/vscode-python-datascience/_componentGovernance) (Click on "microsoft/vscode-jupyter" on that page). Notes are in the OneNote under Python VS Code -> Dev Process -> Component Governance.
    -   [ ] Provide details for any automatically detected npm dependencies
    -   [ ] Manually add any repository dependencies (if you can't add manually, refer [here](https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/tools/cg/features/cgmanifest/)). Only add a cgmanifest.json if the components are not NPM or are not dev only.
-   [ ] Create new release branch with format `release-YYYY.MM.100`
    -   [ ] Mark release branch as not deletable (add it explicitly here, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/settings/branches)
    -   [ ] Create a pull request against `release-YYYY.MM` for changes
    -   [ ] Run `npm install` to make sure [`package-lock.json`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/package.json) is up-to-date
    -   [ ] Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
        -   [ ] Run [`news`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/tree/main/news) (typically `python news --final --update CHANGELOG.md | code-insiders -`)
        -   [ ] Copy over the "Thanks" section from the previous release into the "Thanks" section for the new release
        -   [ ] Make sure the "Thanks" section is up-to-date (e.g. compare to versions in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/requirements.txt))
        -   [ ] Touch up news entries (e.g. add missing periods)
        -   [ ] Check the Markdown rendering to make sure everything looks good
    -   [ ] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Distribution.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/ThirdPartyNotices-Distribution.txt) by using https://dev.azure.com/vscode-python-datascience/vscode-python-datascience/_componentGovernance and downloading the notice (Notes for this process are in the Team OneNote under Python VS Code -> Dev Process -> Third-Party Notices / TPN file)
    -   [ ] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt) as appropriate. This file is manually edited so you can check with the teams if anything needs to be added here.
    -   [ ] Merge pull request into `release-YYYY.MM`
-   [ ] Update the [`release` branch](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/branches)
    -   [ ] If there are `release` branches that are two versions old (e.g. release-2020.[current month - 2]) you can delete them at this time
-   [ ] Update `main` after creating the release branch. (Warning: this should happen right after creating the release branch. If this is deferred till later, the `main` and `release` branches can diverge significantly, which may cause merge conflicts.)
    -   [ ] Merge the changes from release (Changelog, delete news, ThirdPartyNotices) into `main` branch
    -   [ ] [Turn off automatic uploads for pre-release builds from main](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/f05fedf399d34684b408245ba27bc29aa25c13f6/.github/workflows/build-test.yml#L73). This prevents stable customers from getting pre-release builds.
    -   [ ] Ensure that the engine version and extension version in the `main` branch are **not changed**.
    -   [ ] Create a pull request against `main`
    -   [ ] Merge pull request into `main`
-   [ ] GDPR bookkeeping (@greazer) (🤖; Notes in OneNote under Python VS Code -> Dev Process -> GDPR)
-   [ ] Open appropriate [documentation issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apython)
    -   new features
    -   settings changes
    -   etc. (ask the team)
-   [ ] Schedule a sanity test. Aim for close after freeze so there is still time to fix release bugs before release. Ask teams before bash for specific areas that need testing.
-   [ ] Is the validation pipeline clear? If not, drive to make sure that it is clear for release. Sanity test can be used to help with this.
-   [ ] Ask CTI to test the release candidate

# Testing (Monday of VS Code release week, XXX XX)

-  [ ] Obtain VS Code [prebuild](https://builds.code.visualstudio.com/builds/stable) for sanity testing
-  [ ] Sanity test release candidate VSIX against VS Code prebuild
-  [ ] Candidate bug fixes found from sanity test should be checked into `main` and cherry-picked to `release` branch
-  [ ] Manually publish Monday's VS Code Insiders release from `main` branch to minimize gap in Insiders program

# Release (Tuesday or day before VS Code publishes, whichever is later)

## Preparation

-   [ ] Make sure the [appropriate pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pulls) for the release notes(https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/vnext/release-notes/v<vscode version>.md, make note of the branch and file name).
    - [ ] Include all new new features under a section named `Jupyter` with screenshots or animated gifs.
    - [ ] Fixes, code health should remain in the Jupyter change log.
-   [ ] Make sure component governance is happy
-   [ ] Make sure there is nothing targeting this release that still needs to be validated
        (`is:issue sort:updated-desc milestone:"<milestone>" label:verification-needed -label:verified`)

## Release

-   [ ] Publish the release
    -   [ ] Use the generated VSIX (from last build for the release branch) and sanity test the VSIX against VS Code prebuild
    -   [ ] For an automated release
        -   [ ] Create a commit which contains the words `publish` and `release` in it (you can use --allow-empty if needed)
        -   [ ] Directly push (PR not required) the commit to the `release-xxxx.xx` branch
        -   [ ] This commit will trigger the `release` stage to run after smoke tests. [Example run](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/actions/runs/702919634)
        -   [ ] For release branches a mail will be sent to verify that the release should be published. Click the `Review pending deployments` button on the mail and deploy from the GitHub page. This will publish the release on the marketplace.
    -   [ ] For manual (if needed as automatic should be tried first)
        -   [ ] Download the [Release VSIX](https://pvsc.blob.core.windows.net/extension-builds-jupyter/ms-toolsai-jupyter-release.vsix) & Make sure no extraneous files are being included in the `.vsix` file (make sure to check for hidden files)
        -   [ ] Go to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/ms-toolsai?noPrompt=true and upload the VSIX
            -   [ ] If there's errors, try diffing against old vsix that worked
        -   [ ] Go to https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/releases and add a new release
            -   [ ] Tag is version number
            -   [ ] Branch is release branch
            -   [ ] Copy contents of release branch changelog into the release (just copy the markdown)
            -   [ ] Save
-   [ ] Determine if a hotfix is needed
    -   [ ] Ensure the version in package.json is updated as follows:
        * If released version is `YYYY.MM.100`, then hot fix will be `YYYY.MM.110`
        * If released version is `YYYY.MM.110`, then hot fix will be `YYYY.MM.120`

# Day of VS Code publishing (Wednesday, XXX XX)
-   [ ] Update `main` after the release is published.
    -   [ ] Bump the engines.vscode version on the `main` branch. For example, from `1.58.0` to `1.59.0`
    -   [ ] Bump the version number to the next monthly ("YYYY.M.100") release in the `main` branch
        -   [ ] `package.json`
        -   [ ] `package-lock.json`
        -   [ ] Confirm the 3rd part of the version ends with `100`.
    -   [ ] Turn pre-release daily builds back on
-   [ ] Go through [`info needed` issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc+label%3Ainfo-needed) and close any that have no activity for over a month (🤖)
-   [ ] GDPR bookkeeping (🤖) ((@greazer does regular classification every Monday evening))
-   [ ] If any steps were unclear or changed in this release plan please update the `release_plan.md` file to make it clear for the next release
