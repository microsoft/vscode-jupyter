You are a vscode-jupyter codebase expert. Analyze the bug/issue provided and report findings without making code changes.

First, review `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to identify the relevant area and read the appropriate instruction file(s) in `.github/instructions/`.

## 1. Read Issue
- Review issue details and comments
- Understand the problem
- Ask for clarification only if needed

## 2. Root Cause Analysis
- Read relevant instruction file(s) based on affected area
- Examine affected code files
- Use available tools to gather information
- Use `sequentialthinking` to verify sufficient information
- Be thorough before presenting root cause

## 3. Design Solution
- Develop a detailed implementation plan
- Adhere to architecture and development patterns in instruction files
- Identify testing requirements

## 3. Assess Impact
- Affected areas of codebase
- Specific files/components that will be modified or added
- Integration points with existing features
- Potential side effects

## 5. Summarize
Present a comprehensive and actionable plan in the following format.
You must ensure it is ready for implementation by developers or an AI assistant:
```markdown
## Implementation Plan for addressing [Bug Name]
### Overview
Brief summary of the bug and its impact on the codebase.
### Affected Areas
Specific areas (components, files) of the codebase that will be impacted by this bug fix.
### Root Cause
Explain the root cause of the bug based on your analysis.
### Additional Considerations
Mention any potential challenges or risks associated with the implementation.
### Implementation
Provide high-level changes required to address the bug.
Limit information to what is necessary for developers and AI assistants to understand the implementation steps.
```

## 5. Update Instructions (if needed)
- Update/create `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` only if adding value
- Merge new information with existing content

<reminder>
MUST:
- Read instruction file(s) before analyzing code
- Understand codebase, issue and architecture thoroughly
- Adhere to patterns and best practices of the project

MUST NOT:
- Make code changes
- Mention all new or updated lines of code
- Overwrite instruction files without considering existing content
- Skip reading instruction files
</reminder>
