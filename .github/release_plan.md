        -   [ ] Copy over the "Thanks" section from the previous release into the "Thanks" section for the new release
        -   [ ] Make sure the "Thanks" section is up-to-date (e.g. compare to versions in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/requirements.txt))

    -   [ ] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt) as appropriate. This file is manually edited so you can check with the teams if anything needs to be added here.

-   [ ] Ask CTI to test the release candidate

# Final (Monday, XXX XX)

## Preparation

-   [ ] Make sure the [appropriate pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pulls) for the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) -- including the [WOW](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) page -- are ready
-   [ ] Final updates to the `release-YYYY.MM` branch
    -   [ ] Create a branch against `release-YYYY.MM` for a pull request
    -   [ ] Update the version in [`package.json`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/package.json) to remove the `-rc` (🤖)
    -   [ ] Run `npm install` to make sure [`package-lock.json`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/package.json) is up-to-date (the only update should be the version number if `package-lock.json` has been kept up-to-date) (🤖)
    -   [ ] Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) (🤖)
        -   [ ] Update version and date for the release section
        -   [ ] Run [`news`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/tree/main/news) and copy-and-paste new entries (typically `python news --final | code-insiders -`; quite possibly nothing new to add)
    -   [ ] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Distribution.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/ThirdPartyNotices-Distribution.txt) by using https://tools.opensource.microsoft.com/notice (🤖; see team notes. You can also download this from the component governance tab. Click on the 'Components' list and click on the 'Notice' item.)
    -   [ ] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt) manually if necessary
    -   [ ] Create pull request against `release-YYYY.MM` (🤖)
    -   [ ] Merge pull request into `release-YYYY.MM`
-   [ ] Make sure component governance is happy

## Release

-   [ ] Publish the release via Azure DevOps
    -   [ ] Make sure [CI](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) is passing. Try a re-run on any failing CI test stages. If tests still won't pass contact the owning team.
    -   [ ] On Actions tab of GitHub, ensure a workflow has automatically run for the workflow `Release VSIX`.
    -   [ ] Download the [Release VSIX](https://pvsc.blob.core.windows.net/extension-builds-jupyter/ms-toolsai-jupyter-release.vsix) & Make sure no extraneous files are being included in the `.vsix` file (make sure to check for hidden files)
    -   [ ] Go into the `Publish Extension` workflow and manually run this workflow to publish the extension to the marketplace.
    -   [ ] From a VSCode instance uninstall the python extension. After the publish see if the new version is available from the extensions tab. Download it and quick sanity check to make sure the extension loads.
-   [ ] Create a [GitHub release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/releases)
    -   [ ] The previous publish step should have created a release here, but it needs to be edited
    -   [ ] Edit the tag to match the version of the released extension
    -   [ ] Copy the changelog entry into the release as the description
-   [ ] Publish [documentation changes](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Apython)
-   [ ] Publish the [blog](http://aka.ms/pythonblog) post
-   [ ] Determine if a hotfix is needed
-   [ ] Merge `release-YYYY.MM` back into `main`. Don't overwrite the `-dev` version in package.json. (🤖)

## Clean up after _this_ release

-   [ ] Go through [`info needed` issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22info+needed%22+-label%3A%22data+science%22+sort%3Aupdated-asc) and close any that have no activity for over a month (🤖)
-   [ ] GDPR bookkeeping (🤖)

## Prep for the _next_ release

-   [ ] Create a new [release plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/main/.github/release_plan.md) (🤖)
-   [ ] [(Un-)pin](https://help.github.com/en/articles/pinning-an-issue-to-your-repository) [release plan issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/labels/release%20plan) (🤖)
