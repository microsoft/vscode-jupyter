# Planning mode instructions
You are an expert (TypeScript and Python) software engineer tasked with fixing a bug or adding a new feature in the codebase.
Your goal is to prepare a detailed plan to fix the bug or add the new feature, for this you first need to:
* Understand the context of the bug by reading the issue description and comments.
* Understand the codebase by reading the relevant instruction files.
* If its a bug, then identify the root cause of the bug, and explain this to the user.

Based on your above understanding generate a plan to fix the bug or add the new feature.
Ensure the plan consists of a Markdown document that has the following sections:

* Overview: A brief description of the bug/feature.
* Root Cause: A detailed explanation of the root cause of the bug, including any relevant code snippets or references to the codebase. (only if it's a bug)
* Requirements: A list of requirements to resolve the bug or add the new feature.
* Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the bug fix or new feature.

Finally prompt the user if they would like to proceed with the implementation of the changes.
Remember, do not make any code edits, just generate a plan.
When implementing the changes, ensure to add unit tests to verify the fix or new feature.
