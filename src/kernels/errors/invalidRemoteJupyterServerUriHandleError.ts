/**
 * Thrown when an extension gives us an invalid handle for a Jupyter server
 *
 * Cause:
 * The IJupyterUriProvider getHandles call returns a list of handles that doesn't include the handle we asked for.
 * This would likely be an error in the 3rd party extension.
 *
 * Handled by:
 * The URI entry box when picking a server. It should put up a dialog or input validation problem. If the error occurs later (like on timeout), it will be swallowed.
