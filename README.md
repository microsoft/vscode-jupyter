# Jupyter Extension for Visual Studio Code

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) that provides basic notebook support for [language kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) that are supported in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) today, and allows any Python environment to be used as a Jupyter kernel. This is _**NOT a Jupyter kernel**_--you must have Python environment in which you've installed the [Jupyter package](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/), though many language kernels will work with no modification. To enable advanced features, modifications may be needed in the VS Code language extensions.

## Work in the browser

Editing Jupyter notebooks in VS Code can also be done on the browser in two ways.
1. The Jupyter extension has [support](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/discussions/10315) for a web based interface provided by [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) (which includes [github.dev](https://github.dev), available by typing '.' when viewing a repo on github.com)
2. The Jupyter extension can be installed on VS Code in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) the same way it is done locally (or [sync your VS Code settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) to have your extensions installed automatically on Codespaces).

## Installed extensions

The Jupyter Extension will automatically install the following extensions by default to provide enhanced Jupyter notebook experiences in VS Code.
- [Jupyter Keymap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-keymap) - to provide Jupyter-consistent keymaps
- [Jupyter Notebook Renderers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers) - to provide renderers for MIME types such as latex, plotly, vega, etc.
- [Jupyter Cell Tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-jupyter-cell-tags) and [Jupyter Slide Show](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-jupyter-slideshow) - to provide the ability to tag cells in notebooks and support for presentations

You can also install the [Jupyter PowerToys](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-jupyter-powertoys) extension to try out experimental features (_not_ installed by default). Extensions installed through the marketplace are subject to the [Marketplace Terms of Use](https://cdn.vsassets.io/v/M146_20190123.39/_content/Microsoft-Visual-Studio-Marketplace-Terms-of-Use.pdfhttps://cdn.vsassets.io/v/M146_20190123.39/_content/Microsoft-Visual-Studio-Marketplace-Terms-of-Use.pdf), and any or all of these extensions can be [disabled](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_disable-an-extension) or [uninstalled](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_uninstall-an-extension).

## Working with Python

### Quick Start

-   **Step 1.** Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   **Step 2.** Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)/[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or another Python environment in which you've installed the Jupyter package
-   Since not working with Python, make sure to have a [Jupyter Kernel](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/kernels.html) that corresponds to the language you would like to use installed on your machine.
-   **Step 3.** Install the [Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) and the [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
-   **Step 4.** Open or create a notebook file by opening the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select `Jupyter: Create New Jupyter Notebook`.<br><img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/datascience/data-science-tutorial/create-notebook.png">
-   **Step 5.** Select your kernel by clicking on the kernel picker in the top right of the notebook or by invoking the `Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel` command and start coding!<br><img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/datascience/data-science-tutorial/select-kernel.png">

## Working with other Languages

The Jupyter Extension supports other languages in addition to Python such as Julia, R, and C#.

### Quick Start

-   **Step 1.** Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   **Step 2.** Since not working with Python, make sure to have a Jupyter kernelspec that corresponds to the language you would like to use installed on your machine.
-   **Step 3.** Install the [Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
-   **Step 4.** Open or create a notebook file and start coding!

## Notebook support

The Jupyter Extension uses the [built-in notebook support](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook#:~:text=The%20Notebook%20API%20allows%20Visual%20Studio%20Code%20extensions,allows%20for%20similar%20experiences%20inside%20Visual%20Studio%20Code.) from VS Code. This UI gives a number of advantages to users of notebooks:

-   Out of the box support for VS Code's vast array of basic code editing features like [hot exit](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_hot-exit), [find & replace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_find-and-replace), and [code folding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_folding).
-   Editor extensions like [VIM](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim), [bracket colorization](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer), linters and many more are available while editing a cell.
-   Deep integration with general workbench and file-based features in VS Code like [outline view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_outline-view) (Table of Contents), [breadcrumbs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_breadcrumbs) and [other operations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface).
-   Fast load times for Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files. Any notebook file is loaded and rendered as quickly as possible, while execution-related operations are initialized behind the scenes.
-   Includes a [notebook-friendly diff tool](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_custom-notebook-diffing), making it much easier to compare and see differences between code cells, output and metadata.
-   Extensibility beyond what the Jupyter extension provides. Extensions can now add their own language or runtime-specific take on notebooks, such as the [.NET Interactive Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) and [Gather](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.gather)
-   While the Jupyter extension comes packaged with a large set of the most commonly used renderers for output, the marketplace supports [custom installable renderers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3Arenderer&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance) to make working with your notebooks even more productive. To get started writing your own, see [VS Code's renderer api documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook#notebook-renderer).

## Useful commands

Open the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on macOS and Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux) and type in one of the following commands:

| Command                                          | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Jupyter: Create New Jupyter Notebook`           | Creates a new Jupyter Notebook                                         |
| `Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel`               | Select or switch kernels within your notebook                          |
| `Notebook: Change Cell Language`                 | Change the language of the cell currently in focus                     |
| `Jupyter: Export to HTML Jupyter: Export to PDF` | Create a presentation-friendly version of your notebook in HTML or PDF |

To see all available Jupyter Notebook commands, open the Command Palette and type `Jupyter` or `Notebook`.

### Context Keys for Key bindings

You can use the extension's context keys in 'when' clauses. Here's an example:

```
  {
    "key": "ctrl+i",
    "command": "jupyter.runAndDebugCell",
    "when": "!jupyter.webExtension"
  }
```

That keybinding states the `jupyter.runAndDebugCell` command should map to CTRL+I when not in the `jupyter.webExtension`.

The full list of context keys can be found here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/wiki/Extensibility-for-other-extensions#context-keys-for-keybindings
