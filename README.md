# Jupyter Extension for Visual Studio Code Insiders

A [Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) with support for [Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.python.org/) (working towards supporting all [actively supported kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)), including features such as IntelliSense, debugging, and more!

\*If working in VS Code Stable, please see the [Python Extension ReadMe](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/blob/main/README.md) or the [Python Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support).

## Quick start

-   **Step 1.** Install [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)

-   **Step 2.** Install the [Jupyter Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_prerequisites) in VS Code Insiders - CHANGE ME

-   **Step 2.1** If you are interested in using Python, we recommend you install the [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) instead.
-   **Step 3.** Make sure you have a kernel specification that corresponds to the language you would like to use installed on Jupyter on your machine.
-   **Step 4.** Open or create a notebook file and start coding!

## Set up your environment

<!-- use less words -->

- To create a new notebook open the command palette (Windows: Ctrl + Shift + P, iOS: Command + Shift + P) and select the command `"Jupyter: Create New Blank Jupyter Notebook"`
