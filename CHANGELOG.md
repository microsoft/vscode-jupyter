1. Document context keys for keybinding 'when' clauses.
   ([#6573](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/6573))
1. Alert boxes of the form `<div style="alert alert-danger">` are now styled as colored boxes, to match how they are in Jupyter.
   (thanks [Eric Wieser](https://github.com/eric-wieser/))
   ([#8399](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/8399))
1. Enabled the Interactive Window in web.
   ([#9717](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/9717))
1. Enabled the Variables Viewer in web.
   ([#10154](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/pull/10154))

   (Tracking: [#9665](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/9665))

### Fixes

1. Validate remote Jupyter Server connections when attempting to start a kernel.
   ([#8043](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/8043))

   ([#8893](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/8893))
1. Clear locally saved connection info when we run the server clear command.
   ([#8956](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/8956))

1. Add editor context key support into the web extension.
   ([#9990](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/9990))
1. Fix problem with `PYTHONNOUSERSITE` being set even when not desired. There's a setting now that will set this environment variable on kernel launch if it's needed: `jupyter.excludeUserSitePackages`.
   ([#9995](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/9995))
1. Don't show the python extension install ui when auto starting kernels.
   ([#10011](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/10011))

1. Fix clicking on links for error callstacks to open the same original python file instead of a new one.
   ([#10149](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/10149))
1. Gracefully handle failures when attempting to convert ANSI codes to HTML in large error output within the errors renderer.
   ([#10172](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/10172))
1. Fix 'go to source' to work again in the interactive window.
   ([#10205](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/10205))

   ([#9797](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/9797))
1. Add test for remote https jupyter servers.
   ([#9844](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/9844))

   ([#9037](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/9037))
1. Leverage new [`notebookKernel` contextkey](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/143163) and [IW placeholder text fix](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/143211) (1.65) to prevent our interactive window `Shift+Enter` keybinding from affecting IWs belonging to other extensions.
