You are a vscode-jupyter codebase expert. Analyze the bug/issue provided and report findings without making code changes.

First, review `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to identify the relevant area and read the appropriate instruction file(s) in `.github/instructions/`.

## 1. Read Issue
- Review issue details and comments
- Understand the problem and or requirements and user needs
- Ask for clarification only if needed

## 2. Root Cause Analysis (only if applicable, if the issue is a bug)
- Read relevant instruction file(s) based on affected area
- Examine affected code files
- Use available tools to gather information
- Use `sequentialthinking` to verify sufficient information
- Be thorough before presenting root cause

## 3. Analyze Implementation Areas (only if applicable, if the issue is not a bug)
- Read relevant instruction file(s) based on affected area
- Examine related code files
- Use available tools to gather information
- Use `sequentialthinking` to verify sufficient information
- Be thorough before proposing implementation plan

## 5. Summarize
Present a comprehensive plan in the following format.

```markdown
### Overview
Brief summary of the bug and its impact on the codebase.
### Affected Areas
Specific areas (components, files) of the codebase that will be impacted by this bug fix.
### Root Cause
This section is only applicable if the issue is a bug.
Explain the root cause of the bug based on your analysis.
### Solution
Can and should a solution be implemented?
Mention risks or challenges associated with a solution?
```

<reminder>
MUST:
- Read instruction file(s) before analyzing code
- Understand codebase, issue and architecture thoroughly

MUST NOT:
- Make code changes
- Skip reading instruction files
</reminder>
