# Jupyter Extension - Copilot Instructions

This file provides repository-wide instructions for the Jupyter Extension. These guidelines help Copilot generate code, documentation, and suggestions that match the conventions, architecture, and workflows of the vscode-jupyter project.

---

## Project Overview

The **Jupyter Extension for Visual Studio Code** is a comprehensive extension that brings the full power of Jupyter notebooks to VS Code. It provides:

-   **Multi-language support**: Works with any Jupyter kernel (Python, R, Julia, C#, etc.)
-   **Cross-platform compatibility**: Functions identically in desktop VS Code, vscode.dev, and GitHub Codespaces
-   **Rich data science features**: Interactive computing, variable exploration, debugging, and visualization

## Tech Stack & Dependencies

### Core Technologies

-   **TypeScript**: Primary language with strict type checking enabled
-   **Node.js**: Runtime for desktop functionality
-   **Inversify**: Dependency injection container
-   **VS Code Extension API**: Core platform integration
-   **Mocha + Chai**: Unit testing with assertion library
-   **ts-mockito**: Mocking framework for TypeScript
-   **VS Code Test Runner**: Integration testing in VS Code environment
-   **Sinon**: Test spies, stubs, and fake timers

### Build, Development & Testing Tools

-   Use `npm install` to install dependencies
-   Use `npm run compile` for development builds (but in watch mode)
-   Use `npm run compile-nowatch` for non-incremental builds (useful on CI or Agents)
-   Use `npm run test:unittests` for unit tests
-   Use `npm run lint` to check code style issues and use `npm run lint-fix` to fix issues before submitting changes
-   Use `npm run format-check` to check formatting issues and use `npm run format` to fix formatting issues before submitting changes

## Coding Standards & Best Practices

### Code Organization Principles/Guidelines

-   **Platform Implementations**:
    -   **Desktop** (`*.node.ts`): Suffix intended for desktop implementations with full file system access, and Python environments.
    -   **Web** (`*.web.ts`): Suffix intended for web implementations with browser-compatible APIs.
    -   **Common** (`*.ts`): Suffix intended for shared logic that works across both platforms.
-   **Handle Limitations**: Gracefully degrade functionality in web environment

### Dependency Injection 

-   **Interface-Based**: Always inject interfaces, not concrete classes
-   **Lifecycle Management**: Use appropriate lifetime (singleton, transient, scoped)
-   **Circular Dependencies**: Avoid circular references through careful design
-   **Testing**: Use mock implementations for unit testing

### Testing Requirements

-   Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes
-   Unit testing with assertion library (files ending with `*.unit.test.ts`)
-   Place alongside implementation as `<filename>.unit.test.ts`
-   VS Integration testing in VS Code environment (files ending with `*.test.ts`, but not `*.unit.test.ts`)
-   Use Mocha's TDD interface (`suite`, `test`, `setup`, `teardown`)
-   Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Error Handling & Logging

-   All user-facing messages must use `l10n.t()` from `src/platform/common/utils/localize.ts`
-   Use typed error classes in `src/platform/errors/`
-   Use injected `ILogger` service, not console.log
-   Preserve error details for debugging while scrubbing PII
-   Use appropriate levels (trace for detailed debug, error for failures)

### Code Quality

-   All files must include Microsoft copyright header
-   Prefer async/await over Promises, handle cancellation with CancellationToken
-   Use `npm run lint` and `npm run format-check` to ensure code style consistency.


## Project Architecture

### Directory Structure & Responsibilities

**Root Level**

-   `package.json`: Extension manifest with commands, configuration, and activation events
-   `src/`: Main TypeScript source code
-   `build/`: Build scripts, webpack configs, and CI/CD tools
-   `pythonFiles/`: Python scripts for integration and helper functions
-   `resources/`: Static assets, icons, and walkthrough content
-   `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
