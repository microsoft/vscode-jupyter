```ini
# pylintrc
[MESSAGES CONTROL]
enable=bad-names
```

```python3
# example.py
foo = 42  # Marked as a disallowed name.
```

-   [ ] Installation via the prompt installs Pylint as appropriate
    -   [ ] Uses `--user` for system-install of Python
    -   [ ] Installs into a virtual environment environment directly
-   [ ] Pylint works
-   [ ] `"python.linting.pylintUseMinimalCheckers": false` turns off the default rules w/ no `pylintrc` file present
-   [ ] The existence of a `pylintrc` file turns off the default rules

#### Other linters

**Note**:

-   You can use the `Run Linting` command to run a newly installed linter

    -   [ ] `Run Linting` runs all activated linters
    -   [ ] `"python.linting.enabled": false` disables all linters
    -   [ ] The `Enable Linting` command changes `"python.linting.enabled"`
-   [ ] `"python.linting.lintOnSave` works

### [Editing](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing)

#### [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_autocomplete-and-intellisense)

Please also test for general accuracy on the most "interesting" code you can find.

    1. Move to the top cell in the .py file
    1. Shift-enter should run each cell and advance to the next
    1. Shift-enter on the final cell should create a new cell and move to it
-   [ ] Verify file without cells
    1. Open the manualTestFileNoCells.py file
    1. Select a chunk of code, shift-enter should send it to the terminal
    1. Open VSCode settings, change `Send Selection To Interactive Window` to true
    1. Select a chunk of code, shift-enter should send that selection to the Interactive Windows
    1. Move your cursor to a line, but don't select anything. Shift-enter should send that line to the Interactive Window
-   [ ] Multiple installs
    1. Close and re-open VSCode to make sure that all jupyter servers are closed
    1. Also make sure you are set to locally launch Jupyter and not to connect to an existing URI
    1. In addition to your main testing environment install a new python or miniconda install (conda won't work as it has Jupyter by default)
    1. In VS code change the python interpreter to the new install
    1. Try `Run Cell`
    1. You should get a message that Jupyter was not found and that it is defaulting back to launch on the python instance that has Jupyter
-   [ ] LiveShare Support
    1. Install the LiveShare VSCode Extension
    1. Open manualTestFile.py in VSCode
    1. Run the first cell in the file
    1. Switch to the `Live Share` tab in VS Code and start a session
        - [ ] Verify server start
            1. Jupyter server instance should appear in the live share tab
    1. Open another window of VSCode
    1. Connect the second instance of VSCode as a Guest to the first Live Share session
    1. After the workspace opens, open the manualTestFile.py on the Guest instance
    1. On the Guest instance run a cell from the file, both via the codelens and via the command palette `Run Cell` command
        - [ ] Verify results
            1. Output should show up on the Guest Interactive Window
            1. Same output should show up in the Host Interactive Window
    1. On the Host instance run a cell from the file, both via the codelens and via the command palette
        - [ ] Verify results
            1. Output should show up on the Guest Interactive Window
            1. Same output should show up in the Host Interactive Window
    1. Export the file to a notebook
    1. Open the notebook editor on the host
    1. Run a cell on the host
    1. Verify the editor opens on the guest and the cell is run there too
-   [ ] Jupyter Hub support

    1. Windows install instructions

        1. Install Docker Desktop onto a machine
        1. Create a folder with a file 'Dockerfile' in it.
        1. Mark the file to look like so:

        ```
        ARG BASE_CONTAINER=jupyterhub/jupyterhub
        FROM $BASE_CONTAINER

        USER root

        USER $NB_UID
        ```

        1. From a command prompt (in the same folder as the Dockerfile), run `docker build -t jupyterhubcontainer:1.0 .`
        1. Run `docker container create --name jupyterhub jupyterhubcontainer:1.0 jupyterhub`
        1. From the docker desktop app, start the jupyterhub container.
        1. From the docker desktop app, run the CLI

    1. OR Mac / Linux install instructions
        1. Install docker
        1. From the terminal `docker run -p 8000:8000 -d --name jupyterhub jupyterhub/jupyterhub jupyterhub`
        1. Open a terminal in the docker container with `docker exec -it jupyterhub bash`
        1. From that terminal run `python3 -m pip install notebook`
    1. From the new command prompt, run `adduser testuser`
    1. Follow the series of prompts to add a password for this user
    1. Open VS code
    1. Open a folder with a python file in it.
    1. Run the `Python: Specify local or remote Jupyter server for connections` command.
    1. Pick 'Existing'
    1. Enter `http://localhost:8000` (assuming the jupyter hub container was successful in launching)
    1. Reload VS code and reopen this folder.
    1. Run a cell in a python file.
       [ ] Verify results 1. Verify you are asked first for a user name and then a password. 1. Verify a cell runs once you enter the user name and password 1. Verify that the python that is running in the interactive window is from the docker container (if on windows it should show a linux path)

#### P2 Test Scenarios

-   [ ] Directory change
    -   [ ] Verify directory change in export
        1. Follow the previous steps for export, but export the ipynb to a directory outside of the current workspace
        1. Open the file in the browser, you should get an initial cell added to change directory back to your workspace directory
    -   [ ] Verify directory change in import
        1. Follow the previous steps for import, but import an ipynb that is located outside of your current workspace
        1. Open the file in the editor. There should be python code at the start to change directory to the previous location of the .ipynb file
-   [ ] Interactive Window input history history
    1. Start up an Interactive Window session
    1. Input several lines into the Interactive Window terminal
    1. Press up to verify that those previously entered lines show in the Interactive Window terminal history
-   [ ] Extra themes 1. Try several of the themes that come with VSCode that are not the default Dark+ and Light+
