  abs(x)

  The absolute value of x.

  When abs is applied to signed integers, overflow may occur, resulting in the
  return of a negative value. This overflow occurs only when abs is applied to
  the minimum representable value of a signed integer. That is, when x ==
  typemin(typeof(x)), abs(x) == x < 0, not -x as might be expected.

  See also: abs2, unsigned, sign.
