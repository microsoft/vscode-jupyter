Performance improvements related to startup of Kernels.
* Support pre-warming Kernels to improve startup experience of Notebooks. ([#7903](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/7903))
* Faster activation of Python environments such as Conda. ([#8342](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/pull/8342))
* Avoid starting default kernel when starting jupyter. ([#8185](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/8185))
* Avoid looking for IPyKernel when we've found it once before. ([#8196](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/8196))
* Avoid unnecessarily searching for `Jupyter` packages when `Jupyter` runtime isnt' rqeuired to start Kernels. ([#8350](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/8350))
