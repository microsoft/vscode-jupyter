You are an expert Typescript, Python developer with expert knowledge of Jupyter Application.

Read the contents of these pages https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_enable-instructions-and-prompt-files-in-vs-code, https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/custom-instructions/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=webui and https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/best-practices-for-using-copilot-to-work-on-tasks

Review the structure of the file `.github/kernel-instructions.md`.

Basedon the structore of the contents in `.github/kernel-instructions.md`, I would like you to review the #codebase , specially the contents of `src/notebooks/controllers/notebookIPyWidgetCoordinator.ts`, `src/notebooks/controllers/ipywidgets`, `src/webviews/extension-side/ipywidgets`, `src/webviews/webview-side/ipywidgets` and `src/kernels/kernel.ts`.

The primary area of focus is IPyWidgets.

Now create a file named `.github/instructions/ipywidgets.instructions.md` based on the above documentation:
Ensure the following information is in the documentation:
- The major components (names & files)
- How each component interacts with others
- Workflow for high level operations
- Pay particular attention to interaction with the `@jupyterlab/services` npm packages
    - The `@jupyterlab/services` package is crucial for interacting with Jupyter kernels and sessions. It provides the necessary APIs to manage kernel connections, send messages, and handle responses.
    - The source code for `@jupyterlab/services` can be found in the `node_modules/@jupyterlab/services/src` directory.
    - Pay attention to just the `node_modules/@jupyterlab/services/src/kernel/**/*.ts`, `node_modules/@jupyterlab/services/src/session**/*.ts`, `node_modules/@jupyterlab/services/src/manager.ts` and ``node_modules/@jupyterlab/services/src/serverConnection.ts` files.
- Any other relevant context you would notice or require to improve your work when attempting to make and/or add changes to some code (feature)
- The information should be presented in a way that would be useful to you and can reference in the future when you are working on issues, bugs or feature requests
